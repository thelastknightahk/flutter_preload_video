Flutter Video Feed with Preloading


A high-performance Flutter application that demonstrates efficient video preloading and playback in a scrollable feed, similar to popular social media platforms like TikTok or Instagram Reels.
Implementation Steps
1. Project Setup

Create a new Flutter project
Add dependencies in pubspec.yaml:

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_player: ^2.9.5  # For video playback
  provider: ^6.1.5      # For state management

  Run flutter pub get to install dependencies

2. Application Architecture

Implement a Provider-based state management system
Use StatelessWidgets wherever possible for better performance
Create dedicated components for different UI elements

3. Core Components
Provider Implementation

Created VideoPlayerProvider to manage:

Video URLs collection
Controller initialization and lifecycle
Video preloading logic
Playback state management

UI Components

MyApp: Application entry point
VideoFeedScreen: Main screen container (StatelessWidget)
VideoPageView: Handles page scrolling and change detection
VideoPlayerItem: Individual video player component (StatelessWidget)

4. Video Preloading Strategy

Initialize the current video first
Preload adjacent videos (next and previous) in the background
Dispose of controllers properly to manage memory

5. Performance Optimizations

Only initialize videos when needed
Pause non-visible videos
Use lazy loading for controllers
Implement efficient state updates with notifyListeners()

Features

Vertical scrolling feed of videos
Automatic preloading of adjacent videos for smooth playback
Play/pause functionality with tap gesture
Efficient memory management with proper controller disposal
Provider-based state management for clean architecture
Primarily StatelessWidgets for better performance
Visual indicators for video loading and playback state

How It Works

The app starts by initializing the VideoPlayerProvider with a list of video URLs
The first video is initialized and played automatically
As the user scrolls:

The current video is paused
The new video is initialized (if not already) and played
Adjacent videos are preloaded in the background


Tapping on a video toggles play/pause

Code Structure

│   ├── VideoPageView            # Page controller and scroll handling
│   └── VideoPlayerItem          # Individual video player

Dependencies

video_player: Handles video initialization and playback
provider: Manages application state

Performance Considerations

Video initialization happens asynchronously to prevent UI freezes
Only necessary videos are kept in memory
StatelessWidgets are used wherever possible to reduce rebuild overhead
Videos are properly disposed when no longer needed

Potential Extensions

Add caching for faster video reloading
Implement video download progress indicators
Add analytics for video engagement metrics
Implement custom video controls
Add error handling with retry mechanisms
Optimize for different network conditions
